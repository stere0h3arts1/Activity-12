Under the leadership of the Team Asenso administration, everyone is significant in the eyes of God, and the marginalized, the least, the lost, and the last must be given immediate assistance and support. As the Bible says, "Whatsoever You Do to the Least of My Brothers You Do unto Me. (Matthew 25:31-46)
